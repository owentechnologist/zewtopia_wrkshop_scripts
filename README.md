## This repository groups together various code and command examples that are designed to illuminate the  capabilities of Redis

It is expected that you will have a redis-server running with the search and JSON modules loaded

## The goal is to provide an easy copy-paste solution and reference for the Redis-curious
## Examples include Lua scripts and redis-cli commands as well as some simple python code

# Welcome to Zewtopia!  <em>(a very fake zoo)</em>

### To run the sample python code you will need to make sure you have python3 and that redis-py is installed in your environment
``` 
pip3 install redis[hiredis]
```
